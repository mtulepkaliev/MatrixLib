# MatrixLib
Matrix and Vector library written for CS 2300 - Computational Linear Algebra

Implements complex matrix calculations and equation solving using c
Uses C++ operator overloading for basic matrix/vector operations
Includes functions for file I/O operations

main.ccp serves as the driver function (taken from homework assignment)
